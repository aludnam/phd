	\caption{Schematic of the trigger signals in the microscope. The scan-mirror is the master and triggers the camera when it starts moving in one edge of the field. Upon receiving {\sf EXTERNAL\_TRIGGER} the camera starts integrating in less than a microsecond and sets {\sf FIRE} to high. This triggers an interrupt in the micro-controller and it generates {\sf LIGHT\_ENABLE} to modulate the laser. The initial delays determine the position of the scanning lines.The values in the timing diagram (bottom right) were measured with a logic analyser (Logic16, Salea). These values correspond to an optimised timing of the LS-SIM system, such that the sum of the 32 line positions imprinted on the sample produced a homogeneous wide-field illumination.}
