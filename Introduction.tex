\chapter{Introduction\label{ch:Introduction}}
%This will be a general introduction to the problematics of the sub-resolution microscopy. Explaining what to expect in the individual chapters and making the outline of the STORY. 
The motif of this thesis is the resolution of an optical microscope. We present two different techniques providing images with resolution higher than the diffraction limit and demonstrate them on real biological samples. In the theoretical part of the thesis we discuss the effect of noise and fluorescence intermittency on the resolution limit. 

After a general introduction in this chapter, we discuss a new approach in the localisation microcopy in \autoref{ch:NMF}. Application of established machine learning technique of non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) enables us to computationally separate images of individual blinking fluorophores despite their high mutual overlap in the recorded data. We show that with this approach we can use quantum dots (QDs) as a fluorescent labels for super-resolution microcopy. QDs are extremely bright and stable fluorophores and the single QDs can be recorded using a standard CCD camera even without EM enhancement. Data acquisition is therefore simple and does not require any specialised hardware. It can be performed on any wide-field epi-fluorescence microscope equipped with camera which makes this super-resolution method very accessible to wide scientific community. 

\Autoref{ch:Theoretical-limits-of the LM} discusses the resolution criterion for noisy and pixellated data and shows that intermittency of the sources' brightness (blinking) can be beneficial and provide higher resolution when compared to sources with static intensity. 

In the last chapter ChLSSIM \fixme{ref. to LSSIM chapter} we present structured illumination microscopy (SIM) combined with line-scanning (LS). Our goal is to introduce the SIM into more realistic and biologically relevant settings. The line-scanning reduces the out-of-focus fluorescence background, which improves the modulation and the quality of the illumination pattern. The method enables resolution improvement in relatively thick and densely labeled fluorescent samples, which opens SIM-based methods to wider range of biological research. The reconstructed images reveal high details of the specimen’s inner structure and suffer less from the artefacts when compared to the conventional SIM methods.

\section{Optical microscope}

Microscope is an instrument allowing us to see object too small for the naked eye. Optical microscope (often referred as ``light microscope'') uses the light in the visible spectral range ($\lambda\approx400-800\unit{nm}$), which makes it particularly suitable for biological exploration. Visible light is minimally invasive for the sensitive biological samples and allows observation of living specimens. It is also minimally absorbed by water, which prevents the heating of the sample while exposed to visible light.

There are many different types of optical microscopes. The most common is a ``far-field'' microscope, where the light has to propagate for a distance significantly longer then its wavelength. The specimen is usually observed with transmitted, reflected or fluorescent light. This thesis focusses on fluorescence microcopy, which is further discussed in \autoref{sec:Fluorescence microcopy}.

\section{Brief historical overview}

Optical microscopy has been around for over 400 years. Since the very early versions of Zacharias Janssen's or Galileo Galilei's compound microscopes from the beginning of 17\ths\ century, optical microscopy has undergone a long and steady process of development. Despite the speculations who was the actual inventor of the optical microscope, it was Anton van Leeuwenhoek who largely popularised the use of microscope as an instrument for observing minute details of the specimen and who introduce his simple instrument into biological research during the 17\ths\ century. 

An important milestones was the pioneering work of Ernst Abbe \cite{Abbe1873} in the second half of 19\ths\ century. Abbe set the theoretical limit on the resolution of the microscope and mastered the design of objective lenses highly corrected for optical aberrations.

With advances in technology the manufactures have produced lenses reaching the theoretical limits of the optical microscope performance. New microscopy techniques such as Zernike's phase contrast \cite{Zernike1942}, awarded the 1953 Nobel prize in physics, allowed observation of transparent specimens and had major impact on biological research such as in vivo study of cell cycle. 

The emergence of new microcopy methods surpassing the classical resolution limit (super-resolution microcopy) at the end of 20\ths\ century and the beginning of 21\st\ century has given another spin to the optical microscopy research. The resolution of the super-resolution optical microscopes has reached the order of ten nanometers and some researchers proposed the term ``optical nanoscopy'' to be used. However, super resolution micro/nano-scopy remains a challenging task, especially when applied to living biological specimens. While most of the super-resolution techniques require a specialised and expensive hardware, some of the techniques, such as localisation microscopy (discussed in \autoref{ch:NMF}) can be performed on a standard fluorescent microscope. 

The number of scientific publications in recent years shows, that the optical microscopy remains a vibrant and exciting scientific domain.

\section{Point spread function}

An important characteristic of a microscope is so called ``point spread function'' (PSF). PSF represents the microscope's image of a point source. The image $i(x)$ of a specimen produced by an optical microscope can be described as a convolution between the object (specimen) $o(x)$ and the point spread function $q(x)$:
%
\begin{equation}
	i(x)=\int q(x-x')o(x')dx'.
	\label{eq:conv}
\end{equation}  

PSF therefore defines how much is the final image of the specimen going to be ``blurred'' during the imaging process. Integration in \autoref{eq:conv} is over the whole space of acquired data (typically 2D or 3D).

(a) Linear, (b) logarithmic plot of the intensity highlighting the secondary maxima in the Airy pattern and the differences of the Gaussian approximation at the periphery of the function.}
	\label{fig:PSF}
\end{figure}
%
In scalar theory, the two dimensional PSF of an optical microscope, known as the ``Airy pattern'', is described by
%
\begin{equation}
	q(\rho)=\frac{1}{Z}\left(\frac{J_1(\alpha \rho)}{\alpha \rho}\right),
\end{equation}
%
where $Z$ is a normalising constant, $J_1$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one and $\rho$ is the distance from the centre of the image. $\alpha$ depends on the emission wavelength $\lambda_{em}$ and the numerical aperture of the objective $\unit{NA}$:
%
\begin{equation}
	\alpha=2\pi\frac{\unit{NA}}{\lambda_{em}}.
\end{equation}
% 
An intensity profile of a PSF is sown in \autoref{fig:PSF}. The Airy pattern is also compared to a popular approximation of the PSF with Gaussian function \cite{Zhang2007} defined by standard deviation
%
\begin{equation}
	\sigma=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2\pi}\frac{\lambda_{em}}{\unit{NA}}.
\end{equation}

\end{figure}
%
The ability of an optical microscope to show spatial details in the specimen structure is fundamentally limited by diffraction. The radius $\delta$ of the Airy disk (see \autoref{fig:PSF}) is often considered as a ``classical resolution limit''. It is given by
%
\begin{equation}
 	\delta=0.61\frac{\lambda_{em}}{NA}, 
	\label{eq:Airy}
\end{equation}
%
where $\lambda_{em}$ is a wavelength of the emitted light and $NA$ is a numerical aperture of the objective. This resolution limit comes from the empirical observation that if two sources are separated by a distance grater then $\delta$, then we can ``resolve'' them as two individual objects (\autoref{fig:Rayleigh}\ccc). If the separation is smaller then $\delta$ then the point spread functions of the two sources merge together to create a single object and sources therefore become ``unresolved'' (\autoref{fig:Rayleigh}\aaa). The simplicity of the expression and the clear interpretation makes this limit popular in the microscopy community and is usually taken as a bench mark for the resolution techniques. \Autoref{eq:Airy} is sometimes called ``Raleigh resolution limit''. Note that ``Abbe resolution limit'' $\delta=0.5\frac{\lambda_{em}}{NA}$ related to the passband of spatial frequencies is also often used.

The resolution limit \autoref{eq:Airy} relates to the noise-free situation with continuous representation of the PSF. The pixellation and noise associated with photon detection process can alter the ``resolution'' significantly. The influence of noise, pixellation or brightness intermittency to the resolution limit is discussed in \autoref{ch:Theoretical-limits-of the LM}.

\section{Fluorescence microcopy\label{sec:Fluorescence microcopy}}

Introduction of fluorescence microcopy in 20\ths\ century has revolutionised the use of optical microscope in biological and medical science. Fluorescence microscopy detects the fluorescence from the sample itself (auto-fluorescence) or more commonly from the fluorophores attached to the specimen. Fluorescence is typically generated with an excitation light. Important fact is that the excitation light is shifted towards the shorter wavelengths (Stoke's shift),  which allows efficient filtering of the excitation light from the fluorescence signal. 

Fluorescence labels can be attached to the structures of interest with high specificity and provide a strong intensity contrast in the microscopic image of the specimen. The fluorescence proteins, allows for direct expression of the fluorescent marker by the organism itself and further redefined the use of fluorescence microscopy in cell biology as a nearly non-invasive and highly specific technique. 

 The first fluorescent protein used in microscopy (green fluorescent protein - GFP) has been isolated isolated from jellyfish {\it Aequorea victoria}. Nowadays modified versions of GFP and rich variety of fluorescent dyes cover the emission across the whole visible spectral range. A photo-activable and photo-switchable fluorescent proteins and dyes has also been discovered and are used in specific applications and microcopy methods. The 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Martin Chalfie, Osamu Shimomura, and Roger Y. Tsien for their discovery and development of the GFP.

 \section{Quantum Dots\label{sec:Quantum-dots}}

Quantum dots (QDs) are promising fluorescent labels recently used in biological research.  QDs are semiconductor particles composed of about 100-100,000 atoms with diameter of the core $\sim2-10\unit{nm}$. The emission wavelength can be tuned by the diameter of the QD core. QD tend to have a broad excitation spectrum and a narrow emission spectrum when compared to the standard fluorescent dyes/proteins. QD are exceptionally photo-stable (when illuminated with continuous $\sim 50\unit{mW}$ laser they don't bleach even after 14~h, whereas the standard fluorescent dye ``fluorescein'' completely bleaches in less then 20 mins \cite{Jaiswal2004}). Moreover, QDs are order of magnitude brighter than traditional fluorophores \cite{Resch-Genger2008,Walling2009}. 

Commercially available QDs have a polymer coating with covalently attached linker or are conjugated with antibody molecule. This allows them be specifically attached to the structure of interest in the specimen the same way as the standard fluorescent labels. However, coated QD are relatively big ($\sim10-30\unit{nm}$) compared to the fluorescent dyes (fluorescenin size is $\sim1\unit{nm}$) or fluorescent proteins (GFP size is $\sim5\unit{nm}$) and they cannot diffuse through the cell membrane. This complicates the labelling of the structures in the interior of the cell. 

An interesting property of the QDs is that under continuous excitation QDs exhibits a blinking behaviour (fluorescence intermittency). QDs switch between ``ON'' episodes ($\tau_{ON}$) of a rapid absorption-fluorescence cycling and ``OFF'' episodes ($\tau_{OFF}$), where no light is emitted despite the continuous excitation. Both ON-time and OFF-time probability densities follow and inverse power law $P(\tau_{ON/OFF})\propto1/\tau_{ON/OFF}^{m}$ \cite{Kuno2001, Stefani2009}. A comparison of QDs and the standard fluorescent dyes is described in Resch-Genger et al. review article \cite{Resch-Genger2008}.

\section{Super-resolution\label{sec:super-resolution}}

The resolution limit \autoref{eq:Airy} for a far-field optical microscope has been challenged in past two decades. Several research teams have reported sub-diffraction resolution in fluorescent samples. In fact, the resolution limit is no longer dictated by diffraction but rather by the signal-to-noise ratio. 

There is a rich variety of super-resolution strategies, however they are all based on the physical properties of the fluorophores to be driven into emitting (``ON'') or non-emitting (``OFF'') states. This allows to distinguish individual emitters spaced with the sub-resolution distances. 

The ``selective'' activation can be achieved either by structured illuminated excitation or by stochastic activation of individual molecules. In the stochastic activation approach the small random subset of molecules is activated for each acquisition frame. Nearby molecules are therefore activated individually in different time fames. In the conventional approach the activated subset must be sufficiently small to ensure that most emitters are separated by distances larger then the diffraction limit. The images of the individual fluorophores are diffraction limited (they represent a single PSF), however given enough detected photons, they can be localised with precision significantly higher then the resolution limit. These so called ``localisation microcopy'' (LM) techniques include ``Photo-Activation LM'' (PALM) \cite{Betzig2006}, ``Fluorescence PALM'' (fPALM) \cite{Hess2006}, ``Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy'' (STORM) \cite{Rust2006} or ``Super-resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging'' (SOFI) \cite{Dertinger2009}. 

In \autoref{ch:NMF}, we discuss a new localisation microscopy method, which can deal with highly overlapping blinking sources. The individual sources can be ``separated'' computationally post acquisition and localised in the same manner as in the conventional LM techniques. The method allows (but is not limited to) using QDs as exceptionally bright and photo-stable fluorescence labels.

The structured illumination based methods modulate the fluorescence behaviour of the molecules within the diffraction limited area. The nearby molecules are driven to either ``ON'' or ``OFF'' states, which facilitates their discrimination.  These methods include ``Saturated Structured Illumination Microcopy'' (SSIM) \cite{Gustafsson2000,Heintzmann2002} and ``STimulated Emission Depletion microscopy'' (STED) \cite{Hell1994}. 

The last chapter \fixme{ref. to LSSIM chapter} of this thesis introduces a combination of ``(linear) structured illumination microcopy'' with line scanning approach. This combination allows high resolution imaging in relatively thick fluorescent samples, which are challenging for most super-resolution techniques. The ``linear'' stands for the fact that the response of the fluorophores remains proportional to the excitation light. In this case the resolution remains limited, but can be increased by up to a factor of two.  


% This is copied from the first year report: 
%Recently, several super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods (providing resolution beyond the classical resolution limit) have been developed. Microscopic images of fluorescently labelled samples with sub-resolution details have been obtained by using wide range of ideas and strategies. STED (Stimulated Emission Depletion) microscopy \citep{Westphal2003} reduces the individual excitation focal spots through non-linear interaction between two laser pulses of particular spatio-temporal profiles. This excitation spot is swept across the sample (scanning microscopy) and fluorescence signal from sub-resolution volume is registered at each position. Reducing the size of the PSF must be compensated with smaller displacement of the excitation spot and requires then higher acquisition time. SIM (Structured illumination microscopy) \citep{Gustafsson2000,Heintzmann2002} can be regarded as highly parallel form of scanning microscopy. The sample is illuminated with spatially periodic patterns which enables to encode high spatial Fourier frequencies into the detected image. Several `scans' of the pattern across the sample enable us to extract this information and the region of the observed Fourier frequencies can be enlarged. This in turn leads to super resolution in the real space. $\mathrm{I^{n}M}$ \citep{Gustafsson1999} and 4pi microscopy \citep{HellStelzer1992} introduce interference of excitation and (or) emission light and improve resolution mainly along the axial direction. A different approach is used in single-molecule localisation microscopy (LM) \citep{Betzig1995}. This technique takes advantage of the fact that a single isolated point source can be localised with high precision. A Gaussian approximation (mean $\mu$, variance $s^{2}$) of the point spread function (PSF - an ideal image of a point source) can be fit to the recorded image of a point source and its position ($\mathbf{\hat{\mu}}$) can then be estimated with precision $\mathbf{\hat{\sigma}}_{xy}\approx s/\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of detected photons \citep{Hess2006}. It is possible to detect more than $10^{4}$ photons from a single fluorophore and thus the achievable localisation precision can be better than $10\,\mathrm{nm}$ \citep{Churchman2005}. The most successful in terms of number of biological publications has been techniques based on (f)PALM/STORM principles: \textbf{PALM} (\emph{Photo-Activated Localisation Microscopy}) \citep{Betzig2006}, \textbf{fPALM} (\emph{Fluorescence PALM}) \citep{Hess2006} and \textbf{STORM} (\emph{Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy}) \citep{Rust2006_STORM} are three different names for almost identical technique (differences being the type of fluorophore used and fitting algorithms). (f)PAM/STORM methods use the photo-activation property of several fluorescent dyes (or pairs of dyes, STORM) or photo-activable fluorescence proteins ((f)PALM). Under normal conditions these molecules are in a non-fluorescent (`OFF') state. However, after an exposure to the light with $\lambda_{\mathrm{act}}$ wavelength they can be activated into a fluorescent (`ON') state. In this state they can be excited by light with a different wavelength $\lambda_{\mathrm{exc}}$ to emit fluorescent light with a peak at $\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}$ (typically $\lambda_{\mathrm{act}}<\lambda_{\mathrm{exc}}<\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}$). Usually, the sample is continuously exposed to the excitation light $\lambda_{\mathrm{exc}}$ and the activation light $\lambda_{\mathrm{act}}$ is applied in discrete pulses. After each activating pulse $\lambda_{\mathrm{act}}$ a small random subset of fluorophores is activated. Due to the continuous excitation $\lambda_{\mathrm{exc}}$ it emits fluorescence light. If the activated subset is small enough, the individual fluorophores randomly scattered across the sample are well separated (their PSFs do not overlap) and can be localised by fitting the individual PSFs into the pattern. After a certain time of emitting the fluorophore turns back into the dark (OFF) state again. This can be either reversible (`switching', STORM) or irreversible (`bleaching', (f)PALM). An extension of the STORM to three dimensions has been shown in \citep{Huang2008}. A cylindrical lens was inserted in the imaging system introducing astigmatism. Out-of-focus PSF becomes asymmetric (elongated along one lateral direction). The z-dimension is thus encoded in the asymmetry of the PSF when shifting along the axial (z) direction. The resolution improvement down to 20~nm (corresponding to $\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}/30$) was demonstrated \citep{Betzig2006,Rust2006_STORM}. However, a long acquisition time (2-12 hours in the original publications \citep{Betzig2006}) required to collect sufficient density of the fluorophores is the main drawback of these methods even though the required acquisition time has been shortened by several orders of magnitude recently (in 2008 PALM images with $\sim60\,\mathrm{nm}$ resolution ($\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}/8$) with a frame rate 25~s was reported in studies of slow cellular motion dynamics \citep{Shroff2008LiveFPALM}). A fast algorithm for estimation of the position of a large number of individual molecules ($10^{5}$ combined fits and Cramer-Rao lower bound on parameter precision calculation per second) has been presented \citep{Smith2010}. The algorithm is implemented on graphical processing unit and can speed up the post-acquisition analysis of the images by a factor of 10-100 when compared to a modern central processing unit. The algorithm has been shown to reach Cramer-Rao lower bounds on a parameter estimation. Another fast and robust algorithm for data processing consisting of noise reduction, detection of likely fluorophore position, high precision localisation and subsequent visualisation of found fluorophores position has been proposed in \citep{Wolter2010}. fPALM/STORM based techniques can only deal with non-overlapping sources. Separation of individual emitters with overlapping PSFs can significantly speed the acquisition procedure (scaling inversely with the number of molecules localised per bright spot \citep{Small2009}). In 2005 there has been published a method exploiting the fluorescence intermittency (`blinking') of quantum dots under continuous excitation \citep{Lidke2005}. A time series of the blinking quantum dots was recorded and analysed using \emph{Independent Component Analysis} (ICA). The fastICA algorithm \citep{Hyvarinen2000} has been used. As the blinking of the individual quantum dots is independent with respect to each other, individual emitters even with overlapping PSFs can be separated. Localisation of two quantum dots separated down to $23$~nm (corresponding to $\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}/30$) has been reported \citep{Lidke2005}. Further exploration of the technique for more than two sources and for different configuration of the experiment can be found in \citep{Lidke2007}. A Bayesian approach to the blinking of the individual fluorophores has been presented in poster in 2008 \citep{Harrington2008}. A localisation of several quantum dots within the diffracted limited volume has been shown. A method for measurement of sub-resolution distances using the quantum dots has been published in \citep{Lagerholm2006}. However, discrete ON-OFF blinking is required (only one source being ON and others OFF) as opposed to \citep{Lidke2005,Harrington2008} where only fluctuation of the individual sources is required. \textbf{SOFI} (\emph{Super-resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging}), which was published in 2009 \citep{Dertinger2009} relies on higher-order statistical analysis of temporal intensity fluctuations (caused by blinking behaviour of the quantum dots) recorded in a sequence of images. It has been shown that the \emph{n}th order cumulant function (over time dimension) of the recorded sequence is composed of individual emitters with \emph{n}th power of their intensity images (PSFs). This yields the resolution enhancement by a factor $\sqrt{n}$ (for Gaussian approximation of PSF). Resolution improvement down to 60~nm ($\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}/10$) has been reported. In contrast to ICA based methods no prior knowledge about the number of sources is needed. Although there is no fundamental limit for resolution enhancement there are practical ones. Because the PSF is raised to the \emph{n}th power so is the molecular brightness (intensity) of each emitter. Thus the emitter that has intensity two times higher will appear $2^{n}$ times brighter in the \emph{n}th-order SOFI image. Additionally the brightness of each emitter in the SOFI image will be altered by its specific blinking behaviour. An emitter that doesn't fluctuate over the recorded time will not appear in the SOFI image at all.
